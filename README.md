### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Cornelius Tanui

I am an exceptionally skilled data professional with over 5 years of experience in public health, renewable energy, WASH, climate action, and clinical trials. I work full-time as a clinical data manager at [Phastar](https://phastar.com/about-us), even though I have had short, impactful stints as a statistical analysis consultant with various companies in the above-mentioned fields.
